    <h1> Experience Speaks </h1>
    <p> This Page provides you <em>Storiesüìñ</em>, <em>Articlesüìë</em>, <em>Poetryüìú</em>, <em>Thoughts</em> on the basis of experience </p>
    <hr>
<p>This site is not just about writing and reading content, it is about sharing experiences of life and putting forward some thoughts on different topics mostly which are considered taboo in our society in the form of Couplets, Poetry, Paragraphs, Photographs, and videos, which some times we are able to share with others and learn from others but most of the time we failed to share or learn because of this fast-moving life and new generation which mostly believes in scrolling and seeing the photographs and reels.</p>
